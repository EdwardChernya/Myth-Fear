the point is to get more kills of more impressive enemies and to get a title
titles are the rank and display of skill and highscore
and the fun is in the actual game and not some addictive progression
titles like brutal, demon, godkiller



auto attack closest when you are not dragging to move, so kiting will take skill
	can have a target button which you can drag over a target to focus it instead

but what about active abilities with skillshots
	can be a pie menu which would allow you to use a lot of actives with just dragging the middle of the screen
	drawback is this takes time and effort and does not solve the skillshot issue very well
	it can work nicely tho
	if the pie is invisible and only shows the preview in the top left of the current action selected
	and you can edit the pie yourself to add or remove or change order
pie has to be super sensitive so not much movement is needed
and once a skillshot has been selected then you have to aim it by keeping your finger on before you release to cast it
if the game is moderately fast this could work nicely

and this makes it actually pure skill
there is going to be scaling, but playing correctly micro would be way more important if there are skills like blocking/parrying and etc.
basically myth and fear but simpler and html


lastly how the fuck does the map look
auto generated with encounters
its the most heroes aspect of the game
some areas have separate rooms but mostly its one map, until you got a new map
and there are places with enemies rushing towards you, and places with stationary enemies
and places with neutrals who can be allies

neutrals depend on your hero and faction, so some heroes cant get certain allies because they would not be neutral to them
some are straight up allies? sure but they dont auto join you
they ask if they can join and you chose to get them as friend or no

gona need a character menu, allies menu, inventory
	these can all be one icon/menu with multiple tabs
	or simply scrolling down to see each ally's character panel below the hero's


the ui is minimalist, lineage2 but clean without the ornaments
only hp bars on elite enemies on top of screen, your hp is somewhere on the bottom with your resource bar if any

left handed mode basically flips the ui positions

all units have 5 images, 1 idle 1 attack 3 run
heroes have few extra for cast skill, cast spell, and hero specific skills/spells which need a special pose (valkyrie dash with wings etc.)


myth and fear is all about souls aswell
the menu could be souls and stuff

there is also the forces of light vs dark
valkyrja being the light and
idk someone like the demon king is the dark
game can have a short cinematic intro depicting the lore and stuff



main menu can also have units battling in the background
farsigh telescope item pan camera to nearest rare thing and reveal it from fog



pie menu has to be on the right of the move area so that you can play with two thumbs and not cover the middle of the screen



outside edge of map is perma fog so it doesnt confuse you that its walkable


game auto detects aspect ratio and sets controls to phone if is vertical and pc if horizontal



opening chests is epic af, they totaly should give rewards aswell

also any cashgrab browser mmorpg has nice environments	https://www.google.com/search?q=league+of+angels+environments&sca_esv=d3099a39e25ef03c&rlz=1C1CHZL_bgBG765BG765&udm=2&biw=1920&bih=954&sxsrf=AE3TifP5gjbeeEN7OE_KTe-d6Pw2ebN7zw%3A1760297118900&ei=ngDsaNbbNpmpxc8PhtGWyA8&ved=0ahUKEwjWouLjsZ-QAxWZVPEDHYaoBfkQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=league+of+angels+environments&gs_lp=Egtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZyIdbGVhZ3VlIG9mIGFuZ2VscyBlbnZpcm9ubWVudHNIzztQmQVYszpwFHgAkAEAmAGMAaAB2yOqAQUyOC4xOLgBA8gBAPgBAZgCKaAC0xioAgrCAgcQIxgnGMkCwgIFEAAYgATCAgoQABiABBhDGIoFwgIHEAAYgAQYCsICChAjGCcYyQIY6gLCAgQQABgewgIGEAAYCBgemAMGiAYBkgcFMjMuMTigB_exAbIHBTExLjE4uAeWGMIHBjAuNC4zN8gHngE&sclient=gws-wiz-img#vhid=75DmVFnbmDfJKM&vssid=mosaic




how is the stat system going to be?
there will be no damage numbers on screen, no hp bars, so a complex stat system with armor and all kinds of weird things would be counter intuitive
hard coded simple numbers vs enemy numbers
armor, damage and hp and statuses
and magic damage and magic resist

attack damage is purely tied to items and weapon




what kind of upgrades do you get then?
obv there is stronger items, but every hero has a base weapon
1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89?
but if hp and damage scale like this
but armor is percentage reduction, then armor could potentially increase the hp level by an insane amount


so what kind of upgrades are there again?
there are level upgrades, this is the level along the curve the thing you are upgrading is
so weapon is doing 1 2 3 5 8 etc. damage or an ability is doing that
but % damage abilities dont have that, instead they have a % symbol where there would be the curve visual
anyway tho there are

weapon upgrades
ability upgrades
items
stat upgrades (hero specific stats)

weapon upgrades is red
ability upgrades are 
and stats are green

items are usually grey or colored by rarity

items come from chests

weapon upgrades can also come from chests but glowing in red

abilities come from special locations
stats also


each upgrade can have different tiers, lowest tier is +1 then its +2 and so on
similar to item rarities
rarities are grey for common, then silver and gold for now
